# Ahora
Ahora is a simple, static landing page template.

## Why
There are so many landing page templates out there, why another one? Besides the fact I just wanted to build this for personal taste/use, I couldn't find an open-source, simple, client-side only landing page template that had marketing validation features baked right in (although I'm sure many exist). HTML5UP is a great source of beautiful, responsive templates. But each time I used one, I had to go through the same setup process of storing user info (name, email, etc), adding user analytics with Mixpanel and Google Analytics, and setting up UTM tracking.

## Features
All of these features are built in, out of the box. Just add your account ID's and let the data roll in.
- Collect names, emails, phone numbers and store into a simple Firebase account
- Track user engagement with Google Analytics and Mixpanel Analytics
- Ready to store UTM data into Mixpanel
