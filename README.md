# Ahora
Ahora is a simple, static landing page template with marketing tools out-of-the-box.

## Why
"*There are so many landing page templates out there, why another one?*"

Great question! Besides the fact that I just wanted to build this for fun, I couldn't find a **simple, open-source, client-side only landing page template that had marketing validation tools out-of-the-box** (although I'm sure some exist). [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) is a great source for beautiful, responsive client-side templates. But each time I used one, I had to go through the same setup process of [storing](https://firebase.google.com/) a prospective customer's info (name, email, etc), integrating user behavior tracking with [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) / [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/#?modal_active=none), and setting up [UTM](https://www.launchdigitalmarketing.com/what-are-utm-codes/) tracking.

With this template, I've reduced the number of excuses I have for *not* testing an idea, serious or not. Hopefully you can use this to go test ideas in the next few minutes, instead of hours.

**Validation > Building**
